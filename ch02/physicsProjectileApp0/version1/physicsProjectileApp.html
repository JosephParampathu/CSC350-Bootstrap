  <h1>Projectiles</h1>

  <p>In 1600s, armies used equations of motions to calculate
    velocities and angle for firing a missile to hit
    a target. While a quarterback does not do explicit
    calculations using equations of motion, a computerized
    football game will certainly need to do these calculations.
    <br> We will use the metric notations that are favored
    for all scientific and engineering calculations
    <br>
    <br> The following abbreviations will be used:
  </p>

  meters, m
  <br> kilometers, km: 1000 meters make up a kilometer
  <br> meters per second, m/s: units for measuring distance
  <br> meters per second squared, m/s
  <sup>2</sup>: units for measuring acceleration
  <br>

  <p>
    The following physics notation will be used:
  </p>

  Initial velocity, u
  <br> Final velocity, v
  <br> Acceleration, a
  <br> Time, t
  <br> Distance, s
  <br>

  <p>Therefore, some of the useful equations of motion
    for us are:
  </p>

  a = (v - u) / t, which can be arranged to get the following
  equation
  <br> t = (v - u) / a, which can be further arranged as
  <br> v = u + a * t
  <br> s = u * t + 0.5 * a * t<sup>2</sup> , another useful
  equation of motion
